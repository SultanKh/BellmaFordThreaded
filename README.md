# BellmaFordThreaded
Bellman Ford Algorithm simulator in C

  this bellman ford algorithm implented in c, simulate the possible interactions till it finds the sortest rout from one node to another
prints results

accept txt file that conssist all the neccesary information needed about the routs

file format must be in:

"number of nodes"
  
node#1 nodeIP port
node#1 nodeIP port  




node#1 node#2 distance
node#1 node#3 distance
